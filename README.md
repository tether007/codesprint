![Schema Diagram](public/CodeSprint_schema_design.svg)

## The Theme of the Frontend(Client side styling must be Strictly Black and red)

### the flow is -> simple start with a fun puzzle (thinking of doing a simple rickroll idea to fun it up) -> when cracked go to the registration form -> then let prompt them if they want to create a team or is do they wannna join from a **code** of a team lead -> after handling all this stuff , directly jump into challenge 1,2,3 track the progress and so on 

## Endpoints in REST api

### /auth/singup
### /auth/login 
### .... "Fill the rest"

## The global middleware.ts we can use for some 
## also we'll be using Cookies for session handling and JWT for authentication

## in utility Functions(which does a single task best)
### we have auth.ts , validator.ts and also utils.ts(frontend components handler)
